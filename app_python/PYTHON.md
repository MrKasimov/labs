## Best practices

- Using virtual environment
- Followed PEP8 styleguide
- Followed official naming conventions
- Documented the code

I would have used more if only the codebase were bigger. But I read about more practices related to code.

## Why Flask

Flask is super lightweight framework which allows me to quickly finish this lab task.\
It is certainly a production-ready framework, and it is a good choice to start with because of its simplicity.

Pros:

- Flexibility - you can customize different parts because framework does not bring infinite dependencies for your app
- Simplicity - framework is designed to be applied really quickly

Cons:

- Maintenance - framework does not include all features which requires developer to bring them. Maintaining these dozens
  of external dependencies comes at a cost

## Linters

For Python, I used Pylint which suggested adding docstrings.\
For Markdown, I used [Markdownlint](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint).

## Template

Used subset of [this](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template/blob/master/README.md)
template for `README.md`

## Unit tests

This app contains 1 test:

- `test_moscow_time()` is a unit test for verifying that returned time is of Moscow

Best practices:

- Test directory structure has the same structure as of project
- Keeping tests simple - they should test as isolated functionality as possible
- Integrating testing into CI
